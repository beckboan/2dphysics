# 2D Physics Engine Project

A simple rigid-body physics simulator written in C++.

## Introduction

This Physics Engine is a C++ project designed to simulate physical interactions in a 2D environment. It serves as a simple foundation/blueprint that other developers can use to run simulations or build their own physics engine. This project may serve as a helpful project for someone learning C++, as I used it to unique C++ features such as unique pointers, function overrides, virtual inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features

- **Rigid Body Dynamics:**
- **Collision Detection:**
- **Broad Pahse and Narrow Phase:**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
- C++ compiler (C++11 or higher)
- CMake (for building the project)
- SDL2
- OpenGL

### Building

1. Clone the repository:
